**Project Name:** ü™Ñ File Downloads Automator (Python) 

**Description:**

Say goodbye to messy download folders!  This Python script takes the magic ‚ú® out of organizing your downloads by automatically sorting them into designated folders based on their type (audio , video , image Ô∏è, document , or a special SFX category ). It continuously monitors your download directory  and moves new files to the right places, saving you time ‚è≥ and keeping your downloads tidy as can be .

**Key Features:**

- ü™Ñ **Automatic file organization:** No more manual sorting! 
-  **Customizable categories:** Define specific folders for each type to match your workflow. 
-  **Cross-platform:** Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux. 
- ‚ö° **Lightweight and efficient:** Minimal impact on your system. 
-  **User-friendly:** Clear and concise instructions for setup and usage. 

**How to Use:**

**1. Installation:**

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine. ‚¨áÔ∏è
2. Make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed. Check with `python3 --version` in your terminal. If not, download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/): [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

**2. Configuration:**

1. Open `file_downloads_automaton.py` in a text editor. Ô∏è
2. Update these variables with your desired paths:

```python
# Replace with your desired download directory
source_dir = "C:/Users/Username/Downloads"

# Customize folder paths for file types
dest_dir_sfx = "C:/Downloads/SFX"
dest_dir_music = "C:/Downloads/Music"
dest_dir_video = "C:/Downloads/Videos"
dest_dir_image = "C:/Downloads/Images"
dest_dir_documents = "C:/Downloads/Documents"
```

**Note:** Replace `"Username"` with your actual username and adjust paths according to your system.

**3. Running the Script:**

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script's directory. 
2. Run the script with:

```bash
python file_downloads_automaton.py
```

**4. Optional: Set Up Automatic Execution (Windows):**

1. Create a `.bat` file named `start_script.bat` in the same directory as the script. 
2. Add this line to the `.bat` file:

```
python file_downloads_automaton.py
```

3. Now, double-click `start_script.bat` to run the script or schedule it in Task Scheduler for auto-start. 

**Customization:**

- Modify the supported file extensions for each category in the script based on your needs. ‚úèÔ∏è
- Uncomment the `logging.basicConfig(...)` line to enable logging of script activity. ‚úçÔ∏è

**Troubleshooting:**

- If you encounter issues, check the script's comments and search online for solutions related to Python file handling and the `watchdog` library.
